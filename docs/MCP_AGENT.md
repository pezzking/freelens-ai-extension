# Setting Up an MCP Agent for Freelens-AI 📡 

This guide will walk you through setting up an MCP (Model Control Protocol) agent to work with Freelens-AI, enabling you to control and interact with AI agents running on your infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- You have Freelens-AI installed.
- You have Node.js and npx available in your system.
- You have an OpenAI API Key, at the moment it only works with its models

## Configuration

Freelens-AI allows you to configure MCP agents directly from its Preferences page.

1. Open Freelens-AI Preferences<br/>
Launch Freelens-AI and go to the Preferences page then locate the MCP Configuration
section.

2. Enable MCP Support<br/>
Toggle the Enable MCP Agent option.<br />
This enables Freelens-AI to communicate with MCP agents running on your machine or cluster.

3. Add an MCP Server Configuration<br/>
Inside the dedicated JSON textarea, add your MCP server configuration.<br />
Below is the pre-built configuration for the MCP server for Kubernetes, included in Freelens-AI.

```json
{ 
    "mcpServers": { 
        "kubernetes": { 
            "command": "npx", 
            "args": ["mcp-server-kubernetes"] 
        } 
    } 
} 
```

✅ This uses npx to launch the mcp-server-kubernetes module. You can replace
this with your own agent command.

## Troubleshooting

- When you set up MCP Agent, the first message in chat it handles can be slow
  because it need to be initialized (our client should connect to the MCP
  Server you specified), so just wait for it to be fully initialized
